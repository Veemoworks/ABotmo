## Features

The bot includes:
- 11 moderation commands
- 14 miscellanous commands
- 11 fun commands
- 2 server commands
- Saving user roles and reapplying to them on rejoin
- Databases
- Moderation logging
- Bot Status detection
- Logging all commands in console
- Filtering words and spam
- Permission checking
- Reaction Roles
- Music
- & more, soon...

## Key Info

The bot's commands are not suited for other guilds, so as of now (27/03/2025 DD/MM) moderation commands and other(s) are disabled. I do not see any one using the bot in their server so unless someone wants to I will then make a database for more servers and enable all commands.

You will not get commands for ABotmo in DMs as I have not been verified. However for the server command issue, it'll be removed after the above issue is resolved.
