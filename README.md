## Features

The bot includes:
- 8 moderation commands
- 14 miscellanous commands
- 9 fun commands
- Saving user roles and reapplying to them on rejoin
- Databases
- Moderation logging
- Bot Status detection
- Channel-topic updating
- Logging all commands in console
- Filtering words and spam
- Permission checking
- & more, soon...

## Key Info

The bot's commands are not suited for other guilds, so as of now (27/03/2025 DD/MM) moderation commands and other(s) are disabled. I do not see any one using the bot in their server so unless someone wants to I will then make a database for more servers and enable all commands.

You will not get all commands for ABotmo in DMs as I have not been verified, and in the Server you will need to install it into your account to see the rest of the commands. However for the server command issue, it'll be removed after the above issue is resolved.

# 4 NEW GUILD COMMANDS!
___**NEW COMMAND CATEGORY:**___

„Äå **__MUSIC__** „Äç


üî∑ /play
- Enter a search query, string/text or a link the bot will find whatever!

If you enter string/text, the bot will find the first video on YouTube!

If you enter a link, make sure its only a youtu.be.com or a youtube.com link as the bot only supports those!

- The queue system is a bit buggy, so when putting a new song into the queue it may bug out and lag out the music player

- Music player is currently experimental! And you all get "early access", issues I've encountered so far:

1. "Music stopping randomly"

üî∑ /skip
- Skip the current song and play the next song in queue

If no songs in queue left it will leave automatically

üî∑ /stopm
- Clear the music queue and make the bot leave the voice channel

üî∑ /musicqueue
- Display the music queue!

Sorry for the long name, variables is an ass

**ALL COMMANDS IN MUSIC CATEGORY ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIMENTAL, EXCEPT LOW QUALITY AND BUGS/ERRORS!**

# 1 NEW GLOBAL COMMAND!
üî∑ /optout
- Use this to opt out of PUBLIC command logs only!
- Due to this bot being experimental and not being fully out we have public and private command logs, and if you'd like to opt out of command logs you can use this command

There will be a waiting list since im too lazy to make a database and im using a list so i will need to manually update the list
